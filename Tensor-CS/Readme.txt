A series of Matlab codes are provided that allows to reproduce the results included in the paper: "Multidimensional Compressed Sensing and its Applications", by C. Caiafa and A. Cichocki, submitted to Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (2013).

Matlab codes for generation of each Figure in the paper are provided in separated folders. Figures are generated by just running the Main.m script included in each folder.
Some figures (see comments in Main.m script) requires to have the following packages installed:
- MATLAB Tensor Toolbox Version 2.4, Brett W. Bader and Tamara G. Kolda,  http://csmr.ca.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/, March 2010. 
- SGPL1 v1.7: A solver for large-scale sparse reconstruction, Michael P.  Friedlander and Ewout van den Berg, http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spgl1/index.html

Datasets are provided in a separate folder. The credits for these datasets are as follows:
- 3D MRI Brain image (256x256x100). This a the Matlab version of the data-set included in the "University of North Carolina Volume Rendering Test Data Set" archive which is available in public domain at http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata/. 
In this data-set, part of the skull was partially removed (synthetically) in order to reveal the brain structure (provided courtesy of Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., Iselin, NJ.  Data edited (skull removed) by Dr. Julian Rosenman, North Carolina Memorial Hospital).

- Natural scene hyper-spectral image (1024x1024x32). This data-set corresponds to Scene 4 in the Foster & Nascimento & Amano database, available at http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.foster/. No any preprocessing steps were applied to this data-set. This hyper-spectral image contain scene reflectances measured at 32 different frequency channels acquired by a low-noise Peltier-cooled digital camera in the wavelength range of 400-720 nm (see details in reference below).

We thank Dr. Anh Huy Phan for providing us the Matlab codes used to visualize 3D data-sets (visualize3D.m).
